# Heart-Attack-Prediction-using-ML
This project predicts heart attack risk using machine learning. It covers data cleaning, EDA, handling missing values, outliers, and scaling. Models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, and Random Forest are used, with tuning, to find patterns and build an accurate prediction model.
