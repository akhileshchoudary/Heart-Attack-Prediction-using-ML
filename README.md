# Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction

This project analyzes heart attack risk using machine learning, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling.

## Objective
To predict heart attack risk using patient data like age, sex, chest pain type, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset includes features like age, sex, cp, thalach, oldpeak, and a target variable for heart attack risk. Itâ€™s available on Kaggle (not uploaded here due to size).

## Key Steps
- Performed EDA using count plots and swarm plots to analyze categorical and numerical variables.
- Explored correlations, like the moderate link between chest pain (cp) and thalach.
- Trained models: Logistic Regression (87% accuracy), Decision Tree (83%), and Random Forest (90.3%).

## Results
Random Forest performed best with 90.3% accuracy and 93% AUC.
